## Doc & Demo
https://frezc.github.io/react-hooks-common

## Install
```sh
yarn add react-hooks-common
```

Since this module uses React's new [Hooks feature](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-intro.html),
to try this out you'll need to install at least version `16.8.0`
of `react` and `react-dom`:

```sh
yarn add react@^16.8.0 react-dom@^16.8.0
```
